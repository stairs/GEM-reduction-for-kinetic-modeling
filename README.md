This repository contains all code, data, and resources supporting the manuscript **“Putting models in context: deriving a kinetic model of cancer metabolism that includes cellular growth using genome-scale stoichiometric reduction”** (Komkova et al., 2025). The analysis is organized into three subfolders, each with its own README:

- **reduction/**  
  MATLAB scripts for extracting the HT-29–specific genome-scale model and performing stoichiometric network reduction. Refer to `reduction/README.md` for details on model extraction and reduction workflows.

- **sampling/**  
  MATLAB scripts and datasets for Monte Carlo parameter sampling and Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), computing flux control coefficient distributions. See `sampling/README.md` for usage instructions and script descriptions.

- **analysis/**  
  Jupyter notebooks that generate all manuscript figures. See `analysis/README.md` for the figure-to-notebook mapping.
